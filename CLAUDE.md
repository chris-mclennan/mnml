# mnml — a NvChad-style terminal IDE (Rust + ratatui)

Greenfield. Supersedes the `../mnml1` prototype and absorbs `../rqst` (a ratatui
Postman-in-the-terminal) — both are **reference implementations to port logic
from, not dependencies**. Full design + phased roadmap: **`.local/PLAN.md`** (the
authoritative spec; read it before architectural decisions).

## Architecture spine — keep these load-bearing

- **Pluggable input layer.** `Box<dyn InputHandler>` (`src/input/`) translates key
  events into `Vec<EditOp>` (text editing — `src/edit_op.rs`, interpreted by the
  single chokepoint `src/editor.rs::Editor::apply`) or escalates to a small *closed*
  `AppCommand` / a registered command. The editor/buffer/render layers **never**
  branch on which handler is active — only the statusline (mode chip) and the
  cursor-shape code read the 4-variant `EditingMode`. (`grep -rn EditingMode src/ui`
  should hit only `statusline.rs`.) This is "vim way + standard way without
  conditionals everywhere" — the thing the user explicitly wants done right.
- **`Pane` + `Layout` + `Command` registry are the rest of the spine.** `Pane`
  (`src/pane.rs`) is the open-thing enum (Editor today; Pty/Request/Diff/Ai later —
  each additive). `Layout` (`src/layout.rs`) is the split tree (Empty|Leaf today;
  HSplit/VSplit in P3). `Command` (`src/command.rs`, a process-global `OnceLock`) is
  what the palette / which-key / keybindings / plugins all hang off. Adding a feature
  = register commands + maybe a `Pane`/`EditOp` variant — not a refactor.
- **Headless mode (`src/headless.rs`, renders via ratatui `TestBackend`) + the file-IPC
  channel (`src/ipc/`) share `app.rs` + `ui::draw` + `tui::dispatch_*` with the
  terminal loop (`src/tui.rs`)** so headless behavior matches the real UI. This is the
  substrate for the planned `.test` E2E format. IPC lives at `<workspace>/.mnml/ipc/`:
  `command` (JSONL host→mnml), `screen.txt` / `status.json` / `events.jsonl` (mnml→host).
- **No giant files.** `src/app.rs` is render-free; `src/tui.rs` is *only* the crossterm
  event loop; chrome lives in `src/ui/`, subsystems get their own dirs (`src/git/`,
  later `src/http/`, `src/lsp/`, `src/ai/`, `src/cdp/`). mnml1's `tui.rs` (~56k chars)
  and rqst's `app.rs` (~468k chars) both rotted — don't repeat that.
- Storage is a plain `String` + byte cursor in `Editor`; all mutation goes through
  `apply` so a rope can slide in later without touching call sites. Columns are chars
  for now (display-width / tabs / CJK is a P2 refinement).

## Build / run / test

```bash
cargo build            # debug
cargo test             # unit tests
cargo clippy --all-targets   # must be warning-free
cargo fmt              # before committing

./run.sh               # launch mnml in *your* cwd (build + run, relaunch-on-exit-75 loop)
./run.sh ~/some/proj   # launch on a specific workspace
./run.sh restart       # tell the running mnml to rebuild + relaunch (IPC {"cmd":"restart"})
./run.sh stop          # quit the running mnml
./run.sh status        # show the marker (workspace, IPC dir)
./run.sh headless [WS]  # same loop, but --headless (virtual screen + file-IPC)
./dev.sh               # cargo-watch auto-rebuild-on-save loop (needs `cargo install cargo-watch`)

cargo run -- [WS] [--input vim|standard] [--ascii] [--config PATH] [--headless]
cargo run -- run FILE [--env NAME]    # HTTP: send a .http/.curl/.rest file headlessly
cargo run -- chain run FILE           # HTTP: run a .chain.json
cargo run -- discover SPEC [--out DIR]  # HTTP: OpenAPI/Swagger → .curl stubs
cargo run -- test [PATH…]             # run .test E2E scripts (default tests/e2e/); also under `cargo test`
```

**The user keeps a `mnml` instance running via `./run.sh`.** After a `cargo build`
that **succeeds**, run `./run.sh restart` so it picks up the new code. (A
`PostToolUse` hook in `.claude/settings.json` does this automatically; the manual
command is the fallback.) Do **not** restart on a *failed* build — that would tell
the loop to rebuild, fail, and the instance would disappear. `restart` force-relaunches
(bypasses the unsaved-changes guard) and re-reads files from disk, so flag it if the
user might be mid-edit *inside mnml* on something untouched.

## Conventions

- `cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean before every commit. Run the test
  suite. Commit messages end with the `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailer.
- Work on a branch only if asked / on `main` — this repo's default workflow is small
  commits straight to `main` (the user authorized that).
- Don't copy code verbatim from `../mnml1` or `../rqst`; port + restructure.
- When a track needs something from the core, add a `Command` / `EditOp` / `Pane`
  variant — don't special-case across layers.
- The user is happy to have Claude pick which track/feature to do next ("keep going,
  you decide the order — we'll do them all eventually") — choose the most valuable;
  don't ask which. Lean toward *bounded* items when starting a fresh session; save the
  big tracks (the `private` feature, CDP follow-ups, Git GUI phase 4) for when there's room.
  After each landed feature: update this Status block + commit + `./run.sh restart`.

## Status

P0–P3 done. Working: NvChad-ish layout; editable buffers via
either `StandardInputHandler` (VSCode-style, modeless) or `VimInputHandler` (modal:
Normal/Insert/Visual + `:`-line), swappable at runtime (`editor.toggle_keymap` /
`editor.use_vim` / `editor.use_standard` in the palette, or `:set input=vim`);
`:`-commands (`w q wq x q! wa wqa qa bd bn bp e set …`) via `App::run_ex_command`;
selection/undo/clipboard; fuzzy file finder (`Ctrl+P`) + command palette
(`Ctrl+Shift+P` where the terminal supports the kitty protocol, else `F1`) + buffer
switcher (`src/picker.rs` / `src/fuzzy.rs`); config-driven keymap — app-level chords
resolve through `App::keymap` (`src/input/keymap.rs::Keymap`), built from each
`Command`'s default `keys: &[&str]` overlaid with `[keys.global]` / `[keys.<style>]`
config (`"key" = "command.id"`, `= "none"` to unbind); which-key leader popup
(`src/whichkey.rs` trie + `src/ui/whichkey.rs`) — `<space>` in vim Normal or `Ctrl+K`
opens it, keys descend a group, a leaf runs its command (`whichkey.leader` command;
state on `App.whichkey`); editor splits — `Layout` is a binary split tree (`Empty | Leaf |
Split{dir,ratio,first,second}`), `ui::draw` recursively renders one editor per leaf with
1-cell dividers; each leaf shows a distinct buffer, background buffers (in no leaf) are
allowed (bufferline shows all), `App.active` = focused pane = uniquely the focused leaf;
`view.split_right`/`view.split_down`, `view.focus_{left,right,up,down}`,
`view.focus_next_split`, `view.close_split` commands, surfaced in the which-key `+split`
submenu (`<leader>s …` / `Ctrl+K s …`); click a leaf to focus it, drag a divider to
resize it; closing a dirty buffer pops a Save/Discard/Cancel overlay (`src/ui/close_prompt.rs`).
tree-sitter syntax highlight (`src/highlight.rs`, 25 grammars: rs/js/jsx/ts/tsx/py/json/go/
toml/css/bash/html/md/c/cpp/rb/java/cs/lua/yaml/scala/ex/hs/php/swift/make — `build_config` maps file extensions →
`(language, highlights, injections, locals)` query set; `config_for_lang` resolves *injected*
languages so fenced code blocks in markdown / embedded HTML·CSS·JS get highlighted too, and the
markdown `text.*` captures are in `HIGHLIGHT_NAMES`) + indent guides; hybrid relative line numbers (`[ui] relative_line_numbers`,
`:set [no]relativenumber`, `view.toggle_relative_numbers` — cursor line absolute, others = distance).
**Session restore** — `[session] restore = true` (default; flip off to disable). On quit (`save_session_on_quit`, called
from both the `tui` and `headless` loops just before exit) the open editor buffers + their cursors + the **split tree**
(serialized via `SavedLayout`, leaves keyed by index into `open`) are written to `<workspace>/.mnml/session.json`. On
launch (`main.rs` → `try_restore_session` right after `App::new`) the buffers re-open in tab order (skipping any that no
longer exist), then `layout_from_saved` rebuilds `App.layout` from the saved tree (or skips it if any leaf can't be mapped
to a re-opened buffer). The previously-active one gets focus. Workspace mismatch / corrupt json ⇒ silently skip. Layouts
with non-editor leaves (transient pty / browser / etc.) drop the layout part — `saved_layout_from` returns `None` and the
buffer list alone is saved.
**Find-in-buffer** — `find.find` (`Ctrl+F`, palette) prompts for a query (seeded with the active selection or last query),
`accept_find` populates the active buffer's `FindState{query, matches:Vec<(byte_start,byte_end)>, current}`
(`buffer::find_all_ci_ascii` — ASCII case-insensitive, non-overlapping, char-boundary safe), jumps the cursor to the nearest
match at-or-after the cursor (wraps), and toasts `match N/M`. `find.next` (`F3`) / `find.prev` (`Shift+F3`) step through (wrap);
`find.clear` empties the state. `editor_view` paints a `t.bg2` background on every visible match and a `t.yellow` bg on the
current one (with `t.bg_dark` fg for readability). The find state is recomputed on every text-changing edit
(`Buffer::refresh_find_matches`, hooked into `feed_key` + `apply_edit_ops`) so highlights stay in sync as you type.
**Replace** — `find.replace` (`Ctrl+H`) opens a `PromptKind::Replace` (requires a non-empty find state; titled
`Replace N× "<query>" with`). Accept ⇒ `App::accept_replace` builds `EditOp::ReplaceRange` for every match in
*descending* offset order so earlier byte offsets stay valid, hands them to `Buffer::apply_edit_ops` (which also
refreshes the find matches + bumps LSP `didChange`), toasts `replaced N`.
**Workspace grep** — `find.grep` (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) opens a `PromptKind::Grep` prompt (seeded with the selection),
shells out to `rg --vimgrep --no-heading --smart-case <q> .` (or `git grep -n --column -I -e <q>` if `rg` isn't on
PATH); `crate::grep_pane::parse_rg_vimgrep` parses `path:line:col:text` lines (1-based on the wire → 0-based hits,
char-boundary safe, capped at 2000) into `GrepHit{path,rel,line,col,text}`. Results open as a **`Pane::Grep`** in a
split below the focused leaf — `src/grep_pane.rs` = `GrepPane{query,used,hits,selected,scroll}`, `src/ui/grep_view.rs`
renders a header (`N matches · rg: query`) over the hits grouped by per-file `▸ rel  (N)` headers. ↑↓/jk/PgUp/PgDn/g/G
select, Enter jumps to the file + line (and the pane stays open — "jump and keep the list"), `r` re-runs the same query
(swapping in the fresh hits, refreshing the header), `R` replaces every hit across every file (`find.grep_replace` →
`PromptKind::GrepReplace` titled `Replace N× "<query>" with`; per file: if it's open as a clean editor pane apply
`EditOp::ReplaceRange`s through `apply_edit_ops` + `save_to_disk` + LSP `didChange`, else read+splice+write directly,
skipping dirty open buffers with a toast), Esc → tree; wheel moves the selection too. Only one grep pane open at a time
— a fresh query into an existing pane refills it in place.
**Theme engine** (`src/ui/theme.rs`): a `Theme`
struct (named UI colours + `base16[16]`) behind an `RwLock`; `theme::cur()` reads it,
`theme::set(name)` swaps it. Themes are all of NvChad's base46 schemes (~90), converted
to `themes/*.toml` (`[base_30]` + `[base_16]` colour tables), enumerated by `build.rs` →
`THEME_SOURCES` and parsed (serde/`toml`) at first use; `onedark` is the default (also
kept hardcoded as the seed/fallback).
`[ui] theme = "…"` at launch, `theme.pick` command / `:set theme=…` at runtime
(re-highlights open buffers). Markdown preview — `Pane::MdPreview` (`src/ui/md_preview.rs`,
a block-level renderer: headings/lists/fenced code/blockquotes/hrules styled, inline
markers unwrapped, long lines word-wrapped to the pane width via `md_preview::wrap_lines`
[hanging indent for lists/quotes; also used by `ai_view`]); `markdown.preview` command
(`<leader>m`) opens a rendered, read-only, scrollable view in a split next to the source,
refreshed when the source is saved.
Git: branch + change counts in the statusline + tree tint (P0); **gutter line-signs** —
`src/git/diff.rs` parses `git diff HEAD --unified=0` into per-file added/modified/removed
line marks (kept in `GitStatus`'s ~3s-cached `Snapshot.line_changes`), drawn as a coloured
`▎` in the editor gutter; **diff pane** — `Pane::Diff` (`src/ui/diff_view.rs`) shows parsed
hunks (header + context/`+`/`-` lines), `n`/`p` move the cursor hunk, `s`/`u` stage/unstage
it (`git apply --cached [--reverse]`), `r` refreshes, Enter jumps to the hunk's line in the
source editor; `git.diff_file` (`<leader>g d`, opens in a split next to the source) /
`git.diff` (worktree); **blame gutter** — `git.blame_toggle` (`<leader>g b`) swaps the
line-number gutter on the active editor for a per-line `<sha> <author>` column
(`src/git/blame.rs` parses `git blame --porcelain`), refreshed on save; **commit** —
`git.commit` (`<leader>g c`) opens the single-line text-input overlay (`src/prompt.rs` /
`src/ui/prompt.rs`, a generic "type a string, Enter" sibling of the fuzzy picker) →
`git commit -m`; **commit graph** — `Pane::GitGraph` (`src/git/log.rs` reads `git log --all`
+ `for-each-ref` and computes a single-row-per-commit lane layout — node `●`, pass-through
`│`, corner glyphs at branch/merge points; `src/git/graph.rs` = `GitGraphPane` state w/ a
lazily-loaded per-commit detail; `src/ui/git_graph_view.rs` draws the lane graph + commit rows
[hash · ref chips · subject · age · author, selected row highlit] above a detail panel
[message · parents · changed files]). `git.graph` (`<leader>g l`); in the pane ↑↓/jk select,
PgUp/PgDn/g/G jump, Enter opens that commit's diff (`DiffScope::Commit(hash)` → `git show` —
read-only, staging refused), `r` refresh, `y` copy hash, Esc → tree, wheel moves the selection;
commits refresh open graph panes. **staging view** — `Pane::GitStatus` (`src/git/stage.rs`:
`git status --porcelain` → unstaged/staged file lists, `stage`/`unstage`/`stage_all`/`unstage_all`
[`git add` / `git restore --staged`, `git reset` fallback], `staged_diff`; `GitStatusPane` state;
`src/ui/git_status_view.rs` renders the two sections + branch/counts header). `git.status_pane`
(`<leader>g s`); in the pane ↑↓/jk select, PgUp/PgDn/g/G jump, `s`/`u`/Space stage·unstage·toggle,
`a`/`A` all, Enter → that file's diff, `c` commit prompt, `C` ai-commit, `r` refresh, Esc → tree.
**AI commit message** — `git.ai_commit` (`<leader>g m`, also `C` in the staging pane): `claude -p`
summarises `git diff --cached`; the result lands (via `App.pending_commit_msg_job`, sharing `ai_chan`)
in the commit prompt pre-seeded with its first line (`Prompt::seeded`). Per-hunk staging (diff pane),
commit, and staging-pane ops all run through `App::after_git_change()` (refreshes the cached status +
every open `GitGraph`/`GitStatus` pane). **branches / worktrees** — `src/git/branch.rs` (local/remote
branch lists, `git worktree list --porcelain`, `checkout` / `checkout --track` / `checkout -b`):
`git.checkout` (`<leader>g o`, `b` in the staging pane) — fuzzy picker over local + remote branches
→ `git checkout` (remotes via `--track`); `git.new_branch` (`<leader>g n`, `B`) — prompt → `git checkout
-b`; `git.worktrees` (`<leader>g w`, `w`) — picker over the worktrees → opens a shell pane in the chosen
one; after a checkout `App::after_checkout()` refreshes git + tree and toasts (warns if unsaved editors
are open). headless+IPC (interactive TUI listens too) + the `run.sh`/`dev.sh`
wrappers. The statusline git segment shows branch + `⇡ahead ⇣behind` + `✚staged ●modified
…untracked ⚠conflicts` (only the nonzero parts), from `git status --porcelain -b`. The Git
track is done (phase 4 — branch-rail UI [vs the picker], commit-with-Codex, "recompose commit with AI", multi-repo — is queued; see `.local/PLAN.md`). **HTTP track — in progress:** `src/http/` holds `Request`/`Response` +
`send` (reqwest blocking, rustls), `curl.rs` (parse a pasted cURL), `file.rs` (`.http`/
`.rest`/`.curl` parsing, multi-block via `### name`), `template.rs` (`{{VAR}}` from
`.mnml/env/<name>.env` → process env → dynamic `{{$uuid}}`/`{{$timestamp}}`/…), `script.rs`
(`@set-header`/`@set-env` pre-request + `@assert`/`@capture` post-response directives in `#`
comments, with a `.foo.bar[0]`/`$.path` JSON resolver); wired as `mnml run FILE [--env NAME]
[--workspace DIR]` — apply `@set-*` → expand `{{}}` → parse → send → print body → run
`@assert`s (✓/✗, non-zero exit on any failure; without asserts a non-2xx fails) → show
`@capture`s. Inside the IDE: **`rqst.send`** (`<leader>h s`) on a `.http`/`.rest`/`.curl`
editor (the `### block` under the cursor for multi-block files) parses + applies `@set-*` +
expands `{{}}` (env from `.mnml/env/$MNML_ENV`), opens a `Pane::Request` split, and fires
the send on a **background thread** (`App.http_chan`; `App::tick` drains it) — `src/request_pane.rs`
holds the state (`RunState::Sending|Done|Failed`), `src/ui/request_view.rs` renders the
request line + headers + body, then status/headers/pretty body + ✓/✗ asserts + ⇒ captures
(scroll with `k/j`/PgUp/PgDn, `r` re-fires, `y` copies-as-curl, Esc → tree); `rqst.copy_curl`
(`<leader>h y`) copies the request as a curl command. **Chains** — `src/http/chain.rs` runs a
`.chain.json` (`[{ "request": "a.curl", "extract": { "VAR": "$.path" } }, …]`): each step
expands `{{}}` against the running env, sends, runs its `@assert`/`@capture`, then `extract`s
into env vars for the next step; stops at the first transport error / non-2xx-3xx / failed
assert / empty extract — wired as `mnml chain run FILE [--env NAME] [--workspace DIR]`.
**Discover** — `src/http/discover.rs` reads an OpenAPI/Swagger spec (local JSON or http(s)
URL) and writes one `.curl` stub per operation under `<out>/<tag>/<operationId>.curl` (path
params → `{{name}}`, `security` ⇒ `Authorization: Bearer {{TOKEN}}`, JSON body from a spec
`example`); `mnml discover SPEC [--out DIR] [--base-url URL]` (default out `.mnml/requests`).
Still to do for HTTP: editable request-pane field tabs (right now you edit the `.http` file in
a normal editor). **Pty / AI-CLI panes — first cut done:** `src/pty_pane.rs` (`portable-pty` +
`vt100`) — `PtySession` = a live pty + child + a `Mutex<vt100::Parser>` a reader thread pumps;
`BinaryProfile::shell()/claude_code(ws)/codex(ws)` (claude injects `.mnml/CLAUDE.md` via
`--append-system-prompt`); `Pane::Pty(PtySession)`; `src/ui/pty_view.rs` renders the vt100 grid
(theme bg/fg for the default colours, resizes the session to its area each frame, places the
caret when focused, "[process exited]" banner). `term.shell` (`Ctrl+T` / `<leader>a t`),
`ai.claude_code` (`<leader>a c`), `ai.codex` (`<leader>a x`) open one as a stacked split below
the focused leaf. A focused pty forwards keys→bytes to the child (`tui::pty_key_bytes`,
xterm-ish) — the global chords (esp. `Ctrl+E` cycle-focus, `Ctrl+B` tree) are the way back out
since they resolve before pane dispatch; `Ctrl+W` closes the pane (kills child, joins reader).
The event loop polls at 40 ms while a pty is open. **AI on-selection actions — done:** `src/ai/mod.rs`
runs `claude -p --session-id <uuid> "<prompt>"` (the CLI in print mode — tool use, returns text,
user's auth) on a worker thread (`ai::stream_to_channel` — spawns the child, a reader thread pumps
stdout chunks straight to `App.ai_chan` as `AiMsg::Delta`s while it runs, then `settle()` sends a
final `AiMsg::Done`/`Failed`; polls `try_wait` + an `AtomicBool` cancel flag, kills the child if it
goes true; `one_shot_cancellable` is the kept non-streaming variant);
`Pane::Ai(AiPane{title,prompt,session_id,job_id,state:Asking|Streaming(buf)|Done|Failed,scroll,target,cancel})`
shows the answer (the streaming buffer, then the final text) rendered as markdown (via
`md_preview::render_markdown`, with a `▌ …` cursor while `Streaming`) — `src/ui/ai_view.rs` (which
pins the scroll to the tail while streaming). Commands `ai.explain` / `ai.fix` / `ai.refactor` / `ai.write_tests`
(`<leader>a e/f/r/w`) feed the active editor's selection (or the whole buffer if nothing's
selected) + a task prompt; `ai.ask` (`<leader>a a`) takes a free-text question via the prompt
overlay (`PromptKind::AiAsk`). Results stream in via `App.ai_chan` / `App::tick` → `drain_ai_jobs`
(the commit-message job shares the channel — it ignores deltas, acts on the final text); the event
loop polls at 40 ms while a `claude -p` run is in flight (`App::has_pending_ai`). In the AI pane:
`r` re-asks (fresh session), `x` cancels an in-flight run
(`App::cancel_active_ai` → `cancel` flag → worker kills `claude -p`, replies `Failed("cancelled")`),
Esc → tree, **`a` applies the suggested code (two-phase)** — for a `fix`/`refactor` action the source
range is recorded as the pane's `crate::ai::ApplyTarget{path,start,end}`; the *first* `a` extracts the
answer's first fenced code block (`crate::ai::first_code_block`), diffs it against the live range
(`crate::ai::line_diff` — common prefix/suffix trimmed to ±3 context, the middle as `-`/`+`), and stages
it as `AiPane.pending_apply` (the pane renders the diff under a `── proposed change ──` header); the
*second* `a` (`App::do_apply_suggestion`) `ReplaceRange`s it over the range (offsets clamped to the
buffer's current len, edit left dirty — review & undo to revert); `r` (re-ask) discards a staged
suggestion. The `.` key in a request pane is the sibling `App::ai_debug_request` (request + response →
`claude -p`). **`c` promotes a `Pane::Ai` to an interactive Claude Code pane** — `claude --resume <session_id>` in a `Pane::Pty` below, with
the conversation already loaded (so a quick `-p` answer isn't a dead end — you can drill in /
let it apply edits). **JSONL session tail — done:** `src/ai/transcript.rs` reads
`~/.claude/projects/<dashed-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl` into `Vec<Turn>` (user / assistant / thinking
preview / tool-use one-liner / truncated tool-result; meta + side-chain lines skipped); `AiState::Live
{path, last_len, turns}` is a live mirror — `App::tick` (`refresh_live_ai_panes`) appends just the
bytes past `last_len` (up to the last complete line) when the `.jsonl` grows, full-re-reads if it
shrank; `ui/ai_view.rs` renders the turns (assistant text as markdown). `claude` panes are spawned with a
known `--session-id` (`BinaryProfile.session_id`), so `ai.session_view` (`<leader>a m`) opens a
mirror for the active `claude`/Ai pane; `c`-promoting a `Pane::Ai` also flips that pane into a
live mirror of the (now-interactive) session. `G` follows the bottom.
**Playwright track — runner + results tree + trace pane done:** `src/playwright/mod.rs` runs `npx playwright test
--reporter=json --trace=retain-on-failure [args]` on a worker thread (`App.tests_chan` / `App::tick`), parses the JSON report
into a flat `TestRun{tests: Vec<TestCase{title,suite_path,file,line,status,duration_ms,error,trace_path}>}` (ANSI
stripped from error messages; `trace_path` = the retained `trace.zip` from a result's `attachments`); `Pane::Tests(TestsPane{state:Running|Done|Failed,...})` shows the
command + a ✓/✗/≈/⊘ tally + the tests grouped by file (highlighted selection, failure error inline) —
`src/ui/tests_view.rs`. Commands `test.run_all` / `test.run_file` / `test.run_at_cursor` (Playwright's
`file:line` selector) / `test.rerun_failed` (`--last-failed`) under `<leader>T` (`+test` a/f/t/l); in
the pane ↑↓ select, Enter jumps to the test's source, `t` opens the selected test's **trace** (`App::open_selected_test_trace`),
`h` heal-with-Claude, `r` re-runs (same args), `a`/`f` run all/file, `R` last-failed, Esc → tree. **Trace pane** — `src/playwright/trace.rs`
(`parse_trace_zip` reads the `*.trace` NDJSON entries from a `trace.zip` via the `zip` crate, pairs `before`/`after` action records by `callId`,
collects `console` / `error` / `stdio` events, re-bases times → a time-ordered `Vec<TraceEvent{at_ms,dur_ms,kind,title,detail,error}>`)
+ `src/playwright/trace_pane.rs` (`TracePane` state) + `src/ui/trace_view.rs` (a scrollable timeline — `+1.23s  ⏵ page.goto("…")  234ms`,
selected row highlit, the selected event's params/error stack in a panel below). `Pane::Trace`; in the pane ↑↓/jk select, PgUp/PgDn/g/G jump,
`h` heal-from-trace (`TracePane::timeline_text` renders the timeline → `App::heal_from_active_trace` → `claude -p` via `ask_ai`, opening a
`Pane::Ai` — Claude sees the *runtime* trace and uses its tools to read the spec/code; `c` in the answer pane promotes to interactive Claude Code),
`r` re-parses, Esc → tree.
*Follow-ups (per `.local/PLAN.md`):* wrap long detail lines, the `[feature: private]` DocDB live
`Pane::TestExecutions` (dev+staging+prod in one panel) + CodeBuild, a flaky-test dashboard.
**CDP / browser track — first cut done:** `src/cdp/mod.rs` launches Chrome/Chromium (first of a known list) with
`--remote-debugging-port=0 --user-data-dir=<ws>/.mnml/chrome-profile <url>`, reads the chosen port off Chrome's
stderr, hits `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/json` for the first page target's `webSocketDebuggerUrl`, connects via
`tungstenite` (sync, no TLS — DevTools is plaintext localhost), enables `Page`/`Runtime`/`Log`; then a worker
thread pumps the WebSocket ↔ a command channel (`CdpCommand::Send(json)`/`Close`) in one loop (short socket read
timeout makes it cooperative — same shape as the pty/AI workers) and forwards every protocol message up over
`App.cdp_chan` as `CdpEvent::{Connected,Message(json),Closed}`. `Pane::Browser(BrowserPane)` (`src/browser_pane.rs`:
`{url, cmd_tx, log:Vec<LogLine{kind,text}>, net:Vec<NetEntry>, net_focus, net_sel, next_id, pending_eval, scroll, closed}`;
`Drop` sends `Close` → kills Chrome) shows a header (current URL) + a live colour-coded log — console output
(`Runtime.consoleAPICalled`/`Log.entryAdded`/`Runtime.exceptionThrown`), main-frame navigations (`Page.frameNavigated`),
a filtered network log (`Network.requestWillBeSent`/`responseReceived`/`loadingFailed` → `→ GET host/path` / `← 200 …` /
`✗ request failed`, but only Document/XHR/Fetch — the asset firehose is dropped via `cdp_resource_type_is_interesting`),
and `eval` request/result lines — rendered by `src/ui/browser_view.rs`. The same filtered requests are *also* accumulated
as `NetEntry{request_id,method,url,headers,post_data,status,mime,failed}` records (`note_net_request`/`_response`/`_failed`,
matched by `requestId`). `App::drain_cdp_events`/`apply_cdp_message` route events to the pane;
`browser.open` (`<leader>B`, palette) prompts for a URL (`PromptKind::BrowserUrl`) and launches; in the pane `g`
navigates (`PromptKind::BrowserNavigate` → `Page.navigate`), `e` evals JS (`PromptKind::BrowserEval` → `Runtime.evaluate`,
`returnByValue`; the reply is matched by id → a `= …` line), `r` reloads, `s` screenshots (`browser.screenshot` →
`Page.captureScreenshot` → base64 PNG decoded + written to `<ws>/.mnml/screenshots/shot-<ms>.png` via `App::save_screenshot_png`),
k/j/PgUp/PgDn/Home/End scroll, Esc → tree, `Ctrl+W` closes (kills Chrome). **`n` toggles a network panel** — the `net` records
as selectable rows (`METHOD status host/path [mime]`, status colour-coded); ↑↓/jk/PgUp/PgDn/g/G/Home/End move the selection,
`y` copies the selected request as a curl command (`NetEntry::as_curl` — pseudo-headers `:method`/… skipped), `Enter` opens it
in a `Pane::Request` split (`NetEntry::to_request` → `spawn_http_job`, re-sends), `n`/Esc leave the panel (then Esc → tree);
the wheel moves the selection too. (When a request's body isn't inlined — `hasPostData:true` but no `postData` — a
`Network.getRequestPostData` is fired and `BrowserPane::fill_post_data` patches the `NetEntry` when the reply lands.)
**`D` toggles a DOM panel** — first press fires `DOM.getDocument {depth:-1, pierce:true}`; `browser_pane::parse_dom` walks
the reply into a flat `Vec<DomRow{depth,label,selector,node_id}>` (whitespace text + shadow-root wrappers skipped; iframes
recursed); rows render indented + colour-coded (elements blue, text white, comments dim). ↑↓/jk/PgUp/PgDn/Home/End/g/G
move the selection (wheel too), `c` copies the highlighted node's CSS-ish selector (`html > body > div#main.card`),
**`h` draws the live highlight overlay on the page** (`Overlay.highlightNode {nodeId}` — `DOM.enable` + `Overlay.enable` are
in the initial domain-enable set), `R` re-fetches, `D` (or Esc) leave the panel (Esc also clears any highlight via
`Overlay.hideHighlight`). After `s` writes the PNG, `open_path_external` hands it to the OS default app (`open` on macOS,
`xdg-open` on Linux, `cmd /C start` on Windows; best-effort, errors swallowed). `Target.setDiscoverTargets {discover:true}`
is also sent on connect so popups / new-tabs show up as `⤴ new tab → url` log lines (`Target.targetCreated` with
`attached:false`). One browser pane at a time. *Follow-ups:* attach to a picked target (multiple pages), headless mode.
**Right-click context menus — done:** `src/context_menu.rs` (`ContextMenu{title,items:Vec<MenuItem{label,
action: MenuAction}>,anchor,selected}`) + `src/ui/context_menu.rs` (a bordered floating list at the click,
clamped to screen, selected row highlighted). Right-click a tree file → Open / Open in split / Reveal in
Finder / Copy path; a tree dir → Reveal in Finder / Copy path / Refresh tree; a bufferline tab → Close /
Close others / Close all (dirty editors are kept + counted) / Copy path. Modal like the picker — ↑↓/jk
select, Enter runs, Esc / click-away dismisses, click a row runs it. `App.context_menu` +
`open_tree_context_menu` / `open_tab_context_menu` / `context_menu_accept` / `run_menu_action`;
`tui::dispatch_mouse` handles `Down(Right)` → menu on the tree row / tab under it.
**Tasks / launcher — done (first cut):** `[tasks.<name>]` config (`cmd = "shell line"`, optional `cwd`
— relative to the workspace) + `[startup] tasks = ["name", …]`; `task.run` command (`<leader>o`) opens a
picker over the configured tasks and runs the chosen one via `$SHELL -c` in a pty pane
(`BinaryProfile::task`); `App::run_startup_tasks()` (called once by `tui`/`headless` before the loop)
spawns the `[startup]` ones. Absorbs `../private-playwright/start-launcher.sh`: drop it in as a task /
startup task instead of running it separately (the Playwright track will grow native equivalents later).
**`.test` E2E format — done (first cut):** `src/e2e/mod.rs` — a line-based DSL: steps (`write <relpath>
<content>` seed a fixture, `open <relpath>`, `key <spec>`, `type <text>`, `command <id>`, `wait <ms>`)
+ expectations (`expect screen contains|lacks <text>`, `expect dirty <bool>`, `expect pane <substr>`),
run against the same `App` + `ui::draw` the terminal/headless paths use — with a ratatui `TestBackend`
and synthesized key events (no real event loop, no file-IPC; deterministic + fast). `<text>` may be
`"…"`-wrapped (`\n \t \\ \"` unescaped). `mnml test [path…]` runs files/dirs of `.test` (default
`tests/e2e/`), non-zero exit on failure; `tests/e2e.rs` runs `tests/e2e/**/*.test` under `cargo test`
(`edit_and_save`, `command_palette`, `splits`, `markdown_preview`, `vim_mode`, `whichkey`,
`close_prompt`, `buffers`, `theme_picker`). **Plugins — done (first cut):** out-of-process
helpers over the `.mnml/ipc/` channel — IPC commands `register-command {id,title,group,keys}` /
`run-command <id>` / `type <text>`; a `register`ed command (`crate::command::DynCommand` on `App`) shows
up in the palette + resolves as a keybinding (`Keymap::bind`), and invoking it (palette / key / `run-command`)
appends a `{"event":"plugin-command","id":…}` line via `ipc::drain_plugin_events` (called once per run-loop
tick) for the owning plugin to react to; `command::run` falls back to `App::run_dynamic_command` after the
builtin lookup. Protocol + limits documented in `docs/PLUGINS.md` (and it contrasts plugins [out-of-process,
IPC] with Cargo features [compiled-in]); `examples/plugins/insert-timestamp.sh` is a working example.
**LSP — first cut:** `src/lsp/{mod,client}.rs` — one server subprocess per `(project-root, language)`, JSON-RPC
over stdio on a reader thread that forwards `publishDiagnostics` + `definition`/`hover` responses (and replies
`null` to server→client requests so strict servers don't stall) over an mpsc channel `App::tick` drains.
Servers from `[lsp.<name>]` config (`cmd`/`args`/`extensions`/`root_markers`/`language_id`) layered over
built-in defaults (rust-analyzer / pyright-langserver / typescript-language-server / gopls / clangd); an
uninstalled/dying server just disables LSP for that language (no retry, one toast). Wiring: `did_open` on
open, `did_save` on save, a full-text `did_change` on every edit (diagnostics update while typing),
`did_close` when the last pane for a file closes; diagnostics land on `buffer.diagnostics` → `editor_view`
paints a severity dot in the gutter sign cell + tints the line number, `statusline` shows error/warning
counts. Commands `lsp.goto_definition` (`F12` / `<leader>l d`), `lsp.hover` (`<leader>l h`) — the reply opens a
small bordered popup near the cursor (`src/hover.rs` = `HoverPopup`: fences dropped, headings/quotes
stripped, word-wrapped; `src/ui/hover.rs` anchors it below the cursor [flips above / clamps to screen],
title shows the scroll range when it overflows); `App.hover`, arrows/`j`/`k`/PgUp/PgDn scroll it, Esc or
any other key (or a mouse click) dismiss it (all in `tui.rs`'s `dispatch_key`/`dispatch_mouse` top).
`lsp.references` (`<leader>l r`, → fuzzy picker of `path:line:col`, Enter jumps — `PickerKind::Locations`),
`lsp.diagnostics` (`<leader>l e`) — `Pane::Diagnostics` (`src/lsp/diagnostics_pane.rs` = `DiagnosticsPane`
state: every diagnostic on an open buffer, errors-first; `src/ui/diagnostics_view.rs` renders the list
[`▶`-marked selection, `rel:line:col  message  (source)` per row, header err/warn counts]); a "Problems"
panel in a split below the focused leaf — ↑↓/jk select, Enter jumps to the location, `r` refreshes, Esc → tree,
wheel moves the selection; it's rebuilt live whenever diagnostics change (`App::refresh_diagnostics_panes`).
`lsp.next_diagnostic` / `lsp.prev_diagnostic` (`<leader>l n` / `<leader>l p`, `App::lsp_goto_diagnostic`) move
the cursor to the next/prev diagnostic in the active buffer (wrapping) and pop its message in the hover popup.
`lsp.rename` (`<leader>l R`) — one-line prompt (`PromptKind::LspRename`, seeded with the identifier under the
cursor; `App.pending_rename` holds the `(path,line,col)`) → `textDocument/rename`; the reply `WorkspaceEdit`
(`changes` / `documentChanges`, file-ops skipped) is flattened to `LspEvent::Rename` and `App::apply_rename_edits`
edits each file — through `Buffer::apply_edit_ops` + the new `EditOp::ReplaceRange{start,end,text}` if it's open
(left dirty for review), else by splicing the file on disk; `crate::lsp::byte_at` resolves LSP positions →
byte offsets, edits applied descending-by-offset. **completion — as-you-type popup**: `src/completion.rs`
(`CompletionPopup{path, all, filtered, selected, scroll, prefix}` — one `textDocument/completion` reply
populates `all`; `refilter(prefix)` narrows `filtered` locally via `crate::fuzzy` as you keep typing, no
re-request per keystroke) + `src/ui/completion.rs` (a small borderless list anchored just below the caret,
flips above / clamps to screen, selected row highlit, dim `detail` column). `App::completion_on_edit(typed)`
runs after every editor edit (`tui.rs` `BufferEvent::Edited`): refilters an open popup against the new prefix
(closing it when the prefix empties / stops matching), and auto-triggers a fresh `textDocument/completion`
on `.`/`:`(member access) or the first char of a new word; the reply (`apply_lsp_event`) opens the popup
filtered against the *live* prefix. In the popup: ↑↓/Ctrl-N·P move, PgUp/PgDn jump, Tab/Enter accept
(`App::completion_accept` → `EditOp::ReplaceRange` over the identifier prefix left of the cursor →
`item.insert`; snippet items fall back to the label, no placeholder expansion), Esc dismisses, any other key
dismisses + is handled normally, a click dismisses it. `lsp.completion` (`Ctrl+Space` / `<leader>l c`) is the
manual trigger (requests regardless of prefix; same popup). Known simplifications (in `src/lsp/mod.rs`):
full-text doc sync, char-offset columns, `initialize` not awaited before `didOpen`; completion list is
filtered locally after the first reply (no re-request as the prefix grows). Then: CDP follow-ups (network
entries → curl, DOM, screenshots, headless), more `.test` coverage, the `private` Cargo feature (DocDB
`TestExecutions` + CodeBuild + native launcher actions), Git GUI phase 4 (branch rail UI, commit-with-Codex,
recompose-with-AI, multi-repo); plus queued polish (editable request-pane field tabs). See `.local/PLAN.md`.
Highlight follow-ups: more grammars; incremental tree-sitter parsing (needs dropping
`tree-sitter-highlight` for raw `Parser`/`Query` so an old `Tree` can be reused — not bounded);
markdown's `markdown_inline` injection (the callback fires but emphasis/inline-code spans don't
land — some `tree-sitter-md` split-grammar quirk; fenced code blocks DO highlight).

## Not set up yet (could add later)

- `.mcp.json` — no project MCP servers needed yet.
- `.claude/agents/` — a `code-reviewer` subagent could be useful once the codebase grows.
- The repo isn't packaged as a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/`); not needed for a single repo.
