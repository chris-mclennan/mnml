//! The pluggable input layer: `Box<dyn InputHandler>` translates key events into
//! `EditOp`s (text editing) or escalates to an `AppCommand` / a registered command.
//! The editor/buffer/render layers never branch on which handler is active — only
//! the statusline (mode chip) and the cursor-shape code read [`EditingMode`].
//!
//! Two handlers ship today: `StandardInputHandler` (modeless, VSCode-style) and
//! `VimInputHandler` (modal). They swap at runtime via `App::set_input_style`
//! (`editor.toggle_keymap` / `:set input=vim`). A config-driven `[keys.*]`
//! resolver — so both are fully remappable — lands with `keymap.rs` later.
